## description
haz is a simple config file format, that supports simple variable definitions.

it utilizes the `.haz` file extension

## usage
### files
so far `haz` only has a simple syntax that consists of:
```
variable_name:variable_definition;
```

it ignores white spaces so the following would just be the same as above:
```
variable_name    :  variable_definition     ;
```
